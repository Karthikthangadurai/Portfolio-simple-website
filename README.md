Personal Portfolio Website

This is a simple personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. The main goal of this project was to design a clean layout to introduce myself and provide a way for visitors to contact me.

The website includes two main pages:

Home â€“ Brief introduction and profile

Contact â€“ Contact information and message form layout

The structure is built using HTML, and all styling is handled through CSS to create a neat and visually appealing interface. This project helped me understand the basics of how websites are structured and styled from scratch.

It was one of my first personal web development projects, and I enjoyed the process of learning how to create and connect multiple pages. The code is simple, beginner-friendly, and easy to customize. It's a good starting point for anyone who is learning front-end development or creating their own personal site.
