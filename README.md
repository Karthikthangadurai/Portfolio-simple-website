# Portfolio-simple-website
This is a simple portfolio website developed using HTML and CSS. It showcases my basic web development skills.  The layout is built with clean HTML structure, and the styling is done entirely with CSS.I created this project to practice front-end development.It helped me learn how to build and style a webpage from scratch.
